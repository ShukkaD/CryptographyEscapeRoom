# CryptographyEscapeRoom
This is the website for an escape room using cryptographic ciphers.
Before using this, please make sure after downloading this to change the website link in the code for your specific website (instructions in index.js in the comments).

The story behind the escape room is:
You are working in the world's first digitized nuclear power plant. Everything is controlled digitally through the main computer's main frame. This makes it cheaper and more convenient for the owners, 
but if not implemented properly, could lead to security issues. Sadly, the team of people assigned to make sure the power plant software was secure didn't do quality work and left a lot of bugs.
Some hackers were able to exploit this and now they have gained complete control over the mainframe! They messed up all the systems and you have anout 25 minutes before the entire power plant explodes! You must get into the mainframe, break past the hacker's security measures by decrypting their passwords and solving riddles,
and restart the system. Can you do it?
